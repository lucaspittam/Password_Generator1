# Password Generator Starter Code
## Password Generator:

For this project I started with a starter code of html and CSS, and my job was to input the javascript into the file.

## Description: The code is made to generate a random password using the supplied user input(uppercase, lowercase, special characters, and numbers) and displays the  new made password on the page's textbox.
